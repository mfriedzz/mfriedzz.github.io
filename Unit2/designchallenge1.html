	<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>
	<p>The two sites I was most influenced by were:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.plus.google.com">Google+</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Twitter</h2>
		<img src="Twitter Sketch.jpg" height="275" Length="400"><img src="Twitter .png" height="275" Length="400"> <img src="Twitter pdf.jpg" height="215" Length="305">

		<h2>Google + </h2>
		<img src="GooglePlus.jpg" height="275" Length="415"><img src="GooglePlus-Wireframe.png" height="275" Length="415"> <img src="Google+ PDF.jpg" height="275" Length="415">


	<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h1>
	<p>Twitter uses negative or background space to display actual twitter users photos as background in its initial login page. The size of the welcome banner, and quick explaination of the product has an increased relative importance, compared to the background photo's description and date. The smaller focal point and bottom location of the site map on the login page, helps bring balance to the whole sight, contrasting with the Login page element.
	Google+'s default layout uses minimal white space, while keeping the scale of objects of the first page of elements you see, and then uses these same elements size in a sort of pattern below the fold.  
	</p>

	<h1>What makes them similiar and different?</h1>
	<p><strong>Differences:</strong> Twitter utilizes background space much more effectively then google+.  Google+ uses size & balance much more randomly then twitter.  THere are multiple focal points with google+, destroying the hierarchy of google+.  Twitter is much more uniform in its use of balance.
		<strong>Similarities:</strong> They both have a sitemap on their sites, located at the top of the pages.  They both have a flow from top to bottom, using size space, and color contrasts to influence hierarchy and flow.</p>

	<h1>Thumbnail Sketches of a Site I would like to create</h1>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Sketch #1</strong>,<img src="SketchNumber1.bmp" alt="Wireframe #1" />
				<p>The focal point is the logo, spacing for the 3 columns(Odd number of columns  provide greater flexibility) provides even balance, but your eye will be guided to the Larger logo, compared to the two other column images.  The hierarchy will go from left to right, top to bottom, providing flow, initiated by the logo focal point on the far left top</p> </li>
			<li><strong>Sketch #2</strong>,<img src="SketchNumber2.bmp" alt="Wireframe #2" /><br />
				<p>Here this is a simple page design with the focal point being the image up top, with negative (background) space providing a simple backdrop.  There is only one title, providing an easy to read order of importance, leading to the text down below, with 1 or 2 clickable links at most, providing a simple balance, with the other elements, and enforcing a top down hierarchy</p> </li>
			
		</ul>
